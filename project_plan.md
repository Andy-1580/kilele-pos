# Kilele POS - Comprehensive Project Plan

## Project Overview
Kilele POS is a **comprehensive Flutter-based Point of Sale application** designed for small businesses in Kenya. It focuses on inventory management, sales transactions, payments (including M-Pesa), eTIMS tax compliance, and eventual expansion to advanced features like supplier and customer management.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Flutter (Dart) 
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth) 
- **API Integrations:** M-Pesa, eTIMS
- **State:** Provider
- **Local Storage:** SQLite, SharedPreferences
- **Other Packages:** pdf (for receipt), mobile_scanner (for barcode), json_serializable, logger

## Core Components
- **Models:** Product, Transaction, User, Supplier
- **Services:** Database, M-Pesa, eTIMS, Barcode, Reporting
- **Providers:** Auth, POS, Inventory
- **Screens:** Dashboard, POS, Inventory, Transactions, Reporting, Customer, Supplier
- **Widgets:** Reusable components (Buttons, Cards, Dialogs)

## Database Schema (Primary)

|          | Fields |
|---------|---------|
| products | id, name, price, cost, qty, barcode, category |
| transactions | id, items, total, discount, cashier, eTIMS |
| suppliers | id, name, phone, products |
| users | id, role, phone, name |
| eTIMS | submissionId, receipt, status, timestamp |
| payments | id, transactionId, amount, method, mpesaCode |
| inventory | id, productId, qty, restockDates |  

## API Integrations
- **Supabase:** Database, Auth, File Storage
- **M-Pesa:** Payment collection
- **eTIMS:** Tax submission, Invoice validation
- **Other:** Local SQLite for fallback when offline

## Success Metrics
- **Performance:** Transactions < 3 seconds
- **Reliability:** 99.9% service availability
- **eTIMS Compliance:** 100%
- **M-Pesa Success Rate:** > 95%
- **User satisfaction:** Rating > 4.5/5
- **Business Impact:** Better control over inventory, pricing, payments, and tax filing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Backup:** Daily backup to Supabase
- **Offline:** Local cache and retry
- **Rate limiting:** Handle API limits gracefully
- **Error handling:** Exception messages and fallback flows

## Project Timeline (9-10 weeks)

|---------|---------|---------|
| **1-2 (Current)** | 2 wks | Project structure, authentication, services, models |
| **3-4** | 2 wks | POS, Product, Transactions, Barcode |
| **5** | 1-2 wks | Payment (M-Pesa) Integration |
| **6** | 1-2 wks | eTIMS Integration, Invoice submission |
| **7** | 1-2 wks | Customer, Supplier, Reporting |
| **8** | 1 wk | Testing, bug fixes, UI polishing |
| **9-10** | 1 wk | Deployment, training, rollout |
